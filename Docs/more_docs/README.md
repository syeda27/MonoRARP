In this directory we have some additional documentation that touches on a few different ocmponents of our system.
The documentation consists of a `pdf` document generously provided by one of the contributors from Allstate, Juan Carlos Aragon, as well as markdown versions by `djp42` that allow for viewing without downloading. 
The information should be the same.

1. Camera calibration
  - In this folder we describe the prodcedures for calibrating and mounting the camera correctly.
2. Conversion function
  - The documents in this folder cover our procedures for our "conversion function" that we used to evaluate our distance estimation technique in experimenation.
3. Tracker Observations
  - Just some observations about some OpenCV trackers.
