This utils directory is renamed driver_risk_utils to avoid python module look-up collisions.
It contains many of the utility/helper functions and classes, broken down to files based on their respective goals.
Some of the simpler tests are included in this directory, although many of the more complicated tests are in the separate `tests` directory.
